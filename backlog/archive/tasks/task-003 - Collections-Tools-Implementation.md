## Description

Implement all collection management MCP tools (get, create, update, delete)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] get-collections tool retrieves collections correctly
- [x] create-collection tool creates new collections
- [x] update-collection tool modifies collection properties
- [x] delete-collection tool removes collections
- [x] All tools follow xmcp schema patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing tool patterns (greet.ts) and API client usage
2. Create get-collections.ts tool for retrieving collections
3. Create create-collection.ts tool for creating new collections
4. Create update-collection.ts tool for modifying collection properties
5. Create delete-collection.ts tool for removing collections
6. Test all tools work correctly with proper error handling
7. Update task with implementation notes

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented all four collection management tools following the established xmcp patterns:

**Approach taken:**
- Analyzed existing tool structure (greet.ts) to understand xmcp schema patterns
- Used consistent structure across all tools with schema definition, metadata, and default export function
- Leveraged existing RaindropAPI client and TypeScript interfaces from types.ts

**Features implemented:**
1. **get-collections.ts**: Retrieves all collections with formatted display showing title, ID, count, and description
2. **create-collection.ts**: Creates new collections with support for title, description, public visibility, view type, and color
3. **update-collection.ts**: Updates existing collections with validation to ensure at least one field is provided
4. **delete-collection.ts**: Deletes collections with proper destructive operation marking

**Technical decisions and trade-offs:**
- Used Zod for parameter validation with descriptive schema definitions
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Marked delete operation as destructive in metadata annotations
- Made optional parameters properly optional in schemas to avoid requiring unnecessary data
- Used proper TypeScript types from existing types.ts file for type safety

**Modified or added files:**
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/src/tools/collections/get-collections.ts`
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/src/tools/collections/create-collection.ts`
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/src/tools/collections/update-collection.ts`
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/src/tools/collections/delete-collection.ts`

All tools compile successfully and are automatically registered with the xmcp framework through the import-map system.
