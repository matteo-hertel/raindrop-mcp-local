## Description

Set up the basic xmcp project structure with package.json, tsconfig.json, and initial configuration files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project initializes successfully
- [x] xmcp.config.ts is properly configured
- [x] TypeScript compilation works
- [x] Basic project structure matches plan

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing project setup and verify basic xmcp configuration
2. Update package.json with proper project details and dependencies
3. Enhance xmcp.config.ts configuration to match plan specifications
4. Create the basic directory structure as outlined in PLAN.md
5. Add TypeScript types file for Raindrop.io interfaces
6. Test that project builds and runs successfully
7. Verify all acceptance criteria are met

## Implementation Notes

Successfully set up the foundation for the Raindrop.io MCP server project. Key accomplishments:

**Approach taken:**
- Leveraged existing xmcp project structure and enhanced it to match the plan specifications
- Created a clean directory structure that follows the planned architecture
- Established TypeScript types and constants for future API implementation

**Features implemented:**
- Updated `package.json` with proper project description, scripts, and dependencies including TypeScript support
- Enhanced `xmcp.config.ts` with name, description, and tools directory configuration
- Created complete directory structure: `src/tools/{collections,raindrops,tags,highlights,user,filters,import}` and `src/utils`
- Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts` for Raindrop.io API objects
- Created API constants file in `src/utils/constants.ts` with all necessary endpoints

**Technical decisions:**
- Used pnpm for package management (existing lock file)
- Maintained existing TypeScript configuration which works well for the project
- Kept the existing greet.ts tool as a reference example
- Structured types to match Raindrop.io API documentation

**Modified files:**
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/package.json` - Updated project details and dependencies
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/xmcp.config.ts` - Added name, description, and tools configuration
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/src/types.ts` - Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- `/Users/matteohertel/work/code/sandbox/raindrop-mcp-local/src/utils/constants.ts` - Added API endpoints and constants

The project foundation is now ready for API client implementation and tool development. All compilation tests pass and the development server starts successfully.

## Review

**Task Completion Assessment: ✅ READY FOR DONE**

This task has been thoroughly reviewed and meets all requirements for completion:

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
- ✅ Project initializes successfully - Confirmed: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ xmcp.config.ts is properly configured - Verified: Contains name, description, and tools directory configuration
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works - Confirmed: Build succeeds in 2884ms with no errors
- ✅ Basic project structure matches plan - Verified: All planned directories created under `src/tools/` and `src/utils/`

**Implementation Quality Assessment:**
- ✅ **Implementation Plan**: Present and comprehensive, covering all necessary setup steps
- ✅ **Implementation Notes**: Detailed and informative, documenting approach, features, technical decisions, and modified files
- ✅ **File Structure**: Perfect match to planned architecture with directories for collections, raindrops, tags, highlights, user, filters, import, and utils
- ✅ **TypeScript Types**: Comprehensive interfaces created for all Raindrop.io API objects (Raindrop, Collection, User, Tag, Highlight, ApiResponse, ApiError)
- ✅ **API Constants**: Well-structured constants file with base URL and all necessary endpoints
- ✅ **Configuration Files**: Both package.json and xmcp.config.ts properly updated with project details

**Technical Verification:**
- ✅ Build system works: TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Project structure: All required directories and files present
- ✅ Dependencies: Proper TypeScript and xmcp dependencies installed
- ✅ Configuration: xmcp properly configured for development

**Documentation Quality:**
- ✅ All sections present: Description, Acceptance Criteria, Implementation Plan, Implementation Notes
- ✅ File paths documented with absolute paths as required
- ✅ Technical decisions clearly explained
- ✅ Modified files explicitly listed

**Definition of Done Compliance:**
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria marked as completed [x]
2. ✅ Implementation plan was followed
3. ✅ No tests required for foundation setup
4. ✅ Static analysis: TypeScript compilation passes
5. ✅ Documentation: Implementation Notes comprehensive and complete
6. ✅ Task hygiene: Ready for status change to Done
7. ✅ No regressions: Clean build with no errors

**Recommendation:** This task is complete and ready to be marked as Done. The foundation provides a solid base for implementing the Raindrop.io MCP server tools.
